**Raspberry Pi Motion Sensor using Ultrasonic Sensor**

**Overview**
This project uses a Raspberry Pi in combination with an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to create a simple motion detection system. 
The system measures distances using ultrasonic ranging and detects motion by analyzing fluctuations in the measured distance. 
When motion is detected, an LED indicator is triggered.

**Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to create a basic motion sensor system using affordable components and basic programming. 
It demonstrates real-world applications of using sensors with Raspberry Pi for distance measurement, motion detection, and 
alerting mechanisms like an LED.

**Features**
- This project uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure distance.
- Detects motion based on fluctuations in distance readings.
- LED indicator lights up when motion is detected.
- Modular and scalable code for further enhancements.

**Requirements**
- Hardware:
    - Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO support)
    - HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
    - 1 LED
    - Jumper wires and a breadboard
- Software:
    - Python 3.x
    - RPi.GPIO library

  **Installation**
